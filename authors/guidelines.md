## Project Overview

**The Art of Molecular Programming is a community-driven initiative to produce a textbook for our field.**
The purpose of this textbook is to:

1. Define the field
2. Bring together the MP community in a broad collaborative endeavor
3. Collect and disseminate the mature principles of molecular programming
4. Serve as an entry point for incoming researchers to learn about molecular programming
5. Serve as a teaching resource for molecular programming instructors
6. Outline perspectives on future directions for the field

The book will be divided into 3 major sections:
- Molecular self-assembly
- Circuits + information processing
- Interfaces

The complete table of contents can be found [here]({{ "/files/aomp/toc-current.pdf" | relative_url }}).

Editors of the book will be organized into 5 major boards.
Each board has its own structure and responsibilities.
- Executive board
    - Executive Editor: [Dominic Scalise](mailto:scalise@caltech.edu)
    - Executive Editor: [Namita Sarraf](mailto:namita@caltech.edu)
- Topic Boards
    - Molecular self-assembly
        - Topic Lead: [Stefan Badelt](mailto:stef@tbi.univie.ac.at)

**Important Note: We are committed to promoting an inclusive, safe, and constructive working environment. If at any point throughout the project you experience an issue or are made uncomfortable in any way, please contact your Editor to help resolve the problem. If you do not feel comfortable reaching out to your Editor, please contact your Topic Lead (emails listed above). In turn, please contact one or both of the Executive Editors (emails listed above).**
